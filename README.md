# JavaScript-Calculator
Here I have created a four function calculator using JavaScript and a bit of JQuery for DOM Manipulation. The user enters the operation they wish to perform, hits the "=" button and are presented with the calculated result. The program can handle both single operation expressions as well as multiple operation expressions, following standard order of operations rules. Specifically, when presented with multiple operations, first multiplication and division expressions are evaluated in order from left to right, followed by addition and subtraction expressions in the same way. 

Please take a look at my code and reach out with any questions!
